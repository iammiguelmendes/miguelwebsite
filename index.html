                    <h3>Why?</h3>
                    <p>Communication is essential, and nowadays anything can be sold, product, service, value, possessions and more. A great engineer may not have the same impact as an average engineer with great communication.</p>
                    <h3>How?</h3>
                    <p>I always enjoyed communication so I follow people such as Gary Vaynerchuk, Kevin O'Leary and also bought a book written by Tony Robbins and more.</p>
                    <h3>What?</h3>
                    <p>I've done individual and group projects on how to use colors to give emotions, create a content plan/strategy, how to understand the customers, to analyse why company A is doing better than company B, and more.</p>

              <h3>Why?</h3>
              <p>To really understand something, you need to understand how it is made.</p>

                  <h3>Why?</h3>
                  <p>Design is the face of a product, there are people who buy iPhones just because of the design. A good design with a good development is halfway of a completed sale.</p>
