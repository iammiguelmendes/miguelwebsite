                    <p>In this section I want to talk about myself as a person, so that you can know more about me, which I believe to be very important for a recruiter/company.</p>
                    <h3>Who am I</h3>
                    <p>I'm a very determined person with an ambition for knowledge, with a very out of the box mindset.</p>
                    <h3>Random details</h3>
                    <p>I learned to play guitar on my own and I also read books and watch videos about personal finance and entrepreneurship.</p>
                    <h3>Before you continue</h3>
                    <p>My portfolio was made completely by myself which includes research, design and programming, and as you saw in my CV, I basically learned all on my own, so please keep that in mind and also this portfolio is meant to show the growth potential and willingness to learn, which is what a Junior should be all about.</p>

                <p>Here I have some images/videos of my designs.</p>

                <p><b>About Project 3</b></p>
                <p>I improvised and asked a friend of mine what he thought about websites of gaming computer stores and tech stores, and pretented in my mind that he was my client/company product.</p>
                <p>Defined problem: Traditional design and repetitive results <i>(normally in these stores, if you search a computer or a smartphone, the catalog shows your product several times, one time for each available color, for example if you search "Iphone 8", the catalog shows three Iphones 8, "Iphone 8 - WHITE", "Iphone 8 - GREY", "Iphone 8 - BLACK", which my friend disliked).</i>
                <p>Decided to not use a traditional design and to add an option to choose the color, in the product's page.</p>
                <p>Created the prototype, which shall be continued, just like the others.</p>
                <h3>Bonus</h3>
                <p>I've done video editing with Sony Vegas Pro, and image editing with Photoshop as I leave some pictures below with some examples.
                <br>
                <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="photoshop">
                    <img src="dog.png"><a href="dog.png"></a></img>
                    <img src="model.png">
                    <img src="lion.png">
                    <div class="video"><video controls><source src="psvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div>
               </div>
                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>This website, was made by myself with HMTL and CSS, and a small portion of JavaScript for the animations.</p>
                <h3>C# Development</h3>
                <p>I've developed a mobile game, in 2017/2018 using Unity3D, where the user needs to click on the incoming circles in order to not lose.
                <br>I wish I could have made a better design, but it was mandatory to use free sprites/images from the Unity store, since it was a school project.
                <br>Here is a short video about the overall functionality.</p>
                <div class="video"><video controls><source src="Infinia.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div>
                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>I've done functional and automatic testing in Unity3D, in C#, in a work environment.</p>
